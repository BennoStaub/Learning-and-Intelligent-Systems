# Learning-and-Intelligent-Systems

This repository is used to share my exam cheatsheet for the Learning and Intelligent Systems course at ETH Zurich in 2017.
Achieved grade: 6, which is the maximum possible grade.

This cheatsheet covers all the theory from the course and therefore should rather be seen as a summary for your exam preparation. Instead of copying it, I recommend you to use it as reference while creating your own personal and more efficient cheatsheet.

There is no guarantee for correctness or completeness.
